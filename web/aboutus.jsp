<pre id="para1">"HookYourBook is a community for exchanging used books.<br>

HookYourBook lets you give away books you no longer need in exchange for books you really want.<br>

<b>Give & receive:</b><br> Every time you give someone a book, you can get any book you want from the person you give your book at HookYourBook.
 Once you've read a book, you can give it back to the one to whom you swap it with, as per your wish.

<b>No cost:</b><br> there is no cost to join or use this web site: your only cost is when you want to purchase a book"</pre>

<pre id="para2"><b>"Why create this?:</b><br> if you're passionate about books, you know how emotionally difficult it is to throw a book away, even if you will never read it again.
 You want to find a good home for your books, have them find someone who appreciates them. Also, you may be interested in trying a lot of books out, and keep the ones that are great.
 It's a great crime to have a book disappear, out of print, for none to read. HookYourBook keeps books in circulation, and finds new readers for them. If you're not interested in
 getting free books. "</pre>

<pre id="para2"><b>Purchase, sell a book</b><br> If you want to purchase a second hand book with cheaper price and if you want to sell your old books which are no longer in use, but don't
know how to find a seller or buyer then HookYourBook is the best plateform for you. Here, you can find sellers and buyer with the College which saves your time and energy, and that 
time and energy you can invest in reading book<b>:)</b>
